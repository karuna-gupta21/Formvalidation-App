# Formvalidation-App
In the form validation app, you will be creating a frontend user interface that allows users to fill out a form, such as login or signup, while ensuring the input data is valid before submitting it to the backend. This will involve the following key tasks:

Key Features of the App:
Form with Input Fields:

Users will be able to fill out fields like email and password (or other fields based on the design).

The form will be controlled using React Hook Form, which makes handling forms and their validation easier.

Data Validation:

Zod will be used for schema validation, ensuring that the entered data (e.g., email format, password length) is correct before submitting the form.

For example:

Email validation: Ensures the entered email is in a proper email format.

Password validation: Ensures the password is long enough (e.g., at least 6 characters).

Form Handling with React Hook Form:

React Hook Form will manage the form's state and handle the validation.

It will provide error messages next to fields if the user enters invalid data.

Submit the Form:

When the form is valid, it will be submitted to the backend to either log the user in or create a new user.

You'll use React Query to send the form data to your backend API and receive a response (e.g., success message or error).

Error Handling:

Display clear error messages for the user if something goes wrong, either due to form validation or API issues (like wrong credentials or server errors).

Handle things like invalid inputs (e.g., wrong email or short password) or API failures (e.g., network issues).

UI Feedback:

Provide feedback to the user, such as loading states (e.g., "Logging in...") and success/error messages.

This ensures a smooth user experience.

Example of How It Works:
The user opens the app and sees a login form with email and password fields.

When the user submits the form:

Zod validation checks that the email is in the correct format and the password meets the length requirement.

If any field is invalid, an error message appears next to the relevant field (e.g., "Invalid email format").

If all fields are valid, the form data is sent to the backend using React Query.

The backend returns a success or failure response (e.g., a JWT token or an error message).

If successful, the user is logged in; if not, an error message is shown (e.g., "Invalid credentials").
